## Academic Journey

Hi there! I'm Justus, currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Leipzig. My journey into the world of data started with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Friedrich Schiller University Jena, where I honed my programming skills and built a strong foundation in machine learning.

The potential of data science methods to uncover hidden insights and value in data truly fascinates me. My Bachelor's thesis explored the application of transformers for imputation, further fueling my passion for this field.

## Beyond the Data

While I thrive on the challenges of data science, I also believe in embracing a global perspective and engaging with diverse communities. I recently completed a semester abroad at the University of Crete, immersing myself in a new culture and expanding my horizons. I'm also passionate about fostering international connections, having previously served as a webmaster for the Erasmus Student Network in Jena and currently contributing to WILMA Leipzig, an Erasmus welcome initiative.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and cycling, preferrably abroad, and I find balance through martial arts and fitness training.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals from around the world. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss data science, machine learning, or any other topics that spark your interest.

## This Blog
I am running this blog mostly for my own entertainment. But I also run it because I like communicating to others what I spend my time on. This can be difficult for laymen outside my field. That's why I like to establish and share simple formulations and intuitions. Of course, there are also other publications, simply because I like to write from time to time.
